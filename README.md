## Working:

Set up Laravel and Python in your work environment, then all you need to do is get your free [FlightAPI](https://docs.flightapi.io/airport-schedule-api/) for airport schedules and you're all set. Run flight.py and serve the view for the page. You can experiment with different settings via the API documentation.
